Brief descriptions of the predefined exceptions follow:

| **Exception** | **Raised when ...** |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCESS_INTO_NULL` | A program attempts to assign values to the attributes of an uninitialized object. |
| `CASE_NOT_FOUND` | None of the choices in the `WHEN` clauses of a `CASE` statement is selected, and there is no `ELSE` clause. |
| `COLLECTION_IS_NULL` | A program attempts to apply collection methods other than `EXISTS` to an uninitialized nested table or varray, or the program attempts to assign values to the elements of an uninitialized nested table or varray. |
| `CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN` | A program attempts to open an already open cursor. A cursor must be closed before it can be reopened. A cursor `FOR` loop automatically opens the cursor to which it refers, so your program cannot open that cursor inside the loop. |
| `DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX` | A program attempts to store duplicate values in a database column that is constrained by a unique index. |
| `INVALID_CURSOR` | A program attempts a cursor operation that is not allowed, such as closing an unopened cursor. |
| `INVALID_NUMBER` | In a SQL statement, the conversion of a character string into a number fails because the string does not represent a valid number. (In procedural statements, `VALUE_ERROR` is raised.) This exception is also raised when the `LIMIT`-clause expression in a bulk `FETCH` statement does not evaluate to a positive number. |
| `LOGIN_DENIED` | A program attempts to log on to Oracle with an invalid username or password. |
| `NO_DATA_FOUND` | A `SELECT` `INTO` statement returns no rows, or your program references a deleted element in a nested table or an uninitialized element in an index-by table.
Because this exception is used internally by some SQL functions to signal that they are finished, you should not rely on this exception being propagated if you raise it within a function that is called as part of a query. |
| `NOT_LOGGED_ON` | A program issues a database call without being connected to Oracle. |
| `PROGRAM_ERROR` | PL/SQL has an internal problem. |
| `ROWTYPE_MISMATCH` | The host cursor variable and PL/SQL cursor variable involved in an assignment have incompatible return types. For example, when an open host cursor variable is passed to a stored subprogram, the return types of the actual and formal parameters must be compatible. |
| `SELF_IS_NULL` | A program attempts to call a `MEMBER` method, but the instance of the object type has not been initialized. The built-in parameter `SELF` points to the object, and is always the first parameter passed to a `MEMBER` method. |
| `STORAGE_ERROR` | PL/SQL runs out of memory or memory has been corrupted. |
| `SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT` | A program references a nested table or varray element using an index number larger than the number of elements in the collection. |
| `SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT` | A program references a nested table or varray element using an index number (-1 for example) that is outside the legal range. |
| `SYS_INVALID_ROWID` | The conversion of a character string into a universal rowid fails because the character string does not represent a valid rowid. |
| `TIMEOUT_ON_RESOURCE` | A time-out occurs while Oracle is waiting for a resource. |
| `TOO_MANY_ROWS` | A `SELECT` `INTO` statement returns more than one row. |
| `VALUE_ERROR` | An arithmetic, conversion, truncation, or size-constraint error occurs. For example, when your program selects a column value into a character variable, if the value is longer than the declared length of the variable, PL/SQL aborts the assignment and raises `VALUE_ERROR`. In procedural statements, `VALUE_ERROR` is raised if the conversion of a character string into a number fails. (In SQL statements, `INVALID_NUMBER` is raised.) |
| `ZERO_DIVIDE` | A program attempts to divide a number by zero. |
